<p>You are to write an application that is kind of like Twitter. It will allow a user to<br />post a message, and everyone else to see all the messages that have been posted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can edit and delete their own messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Build an application that allows you to add MESSAGEs, list them and view them.</p>
<p><strong>Message object should have at least:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>id</li>
    <li>title</li>
    <li>content</li>
    <li>postedDate</li>
    <li>postedBy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features/Functionalities:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The home page ("/") path should point to a list of all MESSAGE's</li>
    <li>Every page (or template) should have link (or button) to the add path<span>&nbsp;</span><br />("/add") which is the new MESSAGE form</li>
    <li>Use a repository to store your messages</li>
    <li>The user should be able to update, view single messages on their own page, and delete messages.</li>
    <li>Add Bootstrap and styling to make your pages look professional.</li>
    <li>Once your application is working, put it on GitHub.</li>
    <li>Submit your GitHub repository link.</li>
</ul>
